    <h1>Extrication or Independence</h1>
    <div>
      Recently I moved to DaeJeon from chung-ju. Daejeon is bigger than Chun-ju.
      Buildings are higher, Peoples's clothes are fancier, and Transportation
      serviese are also well provided. Daejeon is smaller than Seoul which is
      capital city of korea, in my personal opinion, Daejeon is better than
      Seoul. There are everything in Daejeon execpt the super riches.
    </div>

    <div>
      Moving to Daejeon was not my decision. It was my parents decision. Just
      like all the other perents, my parents always think about my health and
      future. For my future they don't choose cheaper option or second option.
    </div>

    <div>
      Now, you may think I got everything. However that is not true. I got
      nothing. I lost everything. I lost my life. Every decision in my life was
      controlled by parents. I need to Escape from here now.
