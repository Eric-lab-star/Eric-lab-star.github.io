      <h1>What Should I Write</h1>
      <p>
        Writing is incredibly difficult! I don't know how to start or choose a
        topic. Currently, I find myself repeatedly deleting and rewriting
        sentences. To be honest, my biggest obstacle is English. As it's not my
        first language, I lack confidence in my writing. I struggle to express
        my thoughts in English, which can be frustrating. Despite studying
        English for 10 years, I still grapple with it.
